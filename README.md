# -AI-Driven-English-Grammar-and-Creative-Writing-Tool
Developed an innovative AI-based software designed to assist students in learning English grammar more effectively. This tool leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to offer personalized grammar exercises and explanations, enhancing the learning experience through adaptive feedback mechanisms. Additionally, the software features a unique content generation module capable of extending text corpora and creating stylistically consistent stories in the author’s voice. Key functionalities include:

Grammar Teaching Module: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze user input and provide targeted grammatical corrections and learning suggestions.
Corpus Extension: Automatically expands existing text corpora with relevant new content, aiding in comprehensive linguistic analysis and learning.
Authorial Style Mimicry: Generates extended narratives that mirror an author’s style based on sample text inputs, enabling creative storytelling and literary analysis.
This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in machine learning and NLP but also showcases my ability to apply AI technologies to real-world educational tools.
